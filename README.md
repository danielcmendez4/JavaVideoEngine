The video game industry experienced significant growth during the COVID-19 Pandemic as people sought entertainment and socialization while somebody was at home. Super Mario is one of the most iconic and beloved video game franchises in World History, with a massive global following. The release of a new Super Mario game post-COVID would not only provide entertainment for people, but it could also help boost the industry's economic recovery. Super Mario games are known for their accessibility and appeal to a broad audience, including children and adults. The game's immersive nature can provide an escape from the stress and anxiety of the pandemic, offering a sense of adventure and excitement. This is a description of the solo project I do for Video Game Programming at Lehman college. I just make my own Developmental Video Game from scratch without ever using any libraries or frameworks.
